Marvin Suite Mol Convert for conversion from sdf file to SMILES was used to extract structure representations provided by Mansouri, using the following line of code in the command line:

C:\Program Files\ChemAxon\MarvinSuite\bin\molconvert csv -o data.csv -c   "" data.sdf


To split the data into test, validation, and training set we used Microsoft Excel.

The identifiers were randomly shuffled using the rand() function. The first 10% with the lowest random number were permanently assigned to the test set.

The remaining data were randomly split into training and validation set using again the rand() function. For every new training set, the first 80% of identifiers with the lowest random number were permanently assigned to the training set, the remaining 20% to the validation set.

The SMILES with corresponding identifier were then assigned to a specific set using the COUNTIF() function.

Example function:

=IF(COUNTIF($C$2:$C$10001,A2)=0,FALSE,TRUE)

Whereby A is the column of the identifier next to the SMILES that needs to be assigned to a specific set, and the first 10 000 values in column C represent the identifiers assigned to the training set.

This method assures that all representations of a chemical (e.g. tautomers) will be assigned to the same data set (e.g. training). A simple random split of all SMILES would undermine the meaning of the validation set, because the model could learn on chemicals of the validation set.


The final dataset was randomly shuffled, again using the rand() function and saved as a csv file containing the SMILES and experimental log P value.
